|**ligStudio**|Dark/light background is imposed behind the subject, lighting accentuates details of the figure in the foreground. |
|**modArtStation**|This modifier will sample extra training data from the most-liked artwork from the website ArtStation. Images which trend on ArtStation are usually very visually-appealing as it means the ArtStation community enjoys those images, so filtering the data to produce images similar to those will greatly increase the quality of the generated art. |
|**modAwardWinning**|Images in the dataset with captions like “Award-Winning Art” are usually extremely creative and original, so using this modifier can greatly improve the quality and inventiveness of your generations. |
|**modDetailed**| Adds more precise details to the output, instead of simple art, but can also make the art overwhelming/over the top in small details. |
|**modFanart**|This gives the generation a cute young amateur graphic design feel, adding hearts to the image and so on. |
|**modPhotorealistic**|This will make the art have a lot of detail, but still be stylized, and it will still be art. Do NOT use this if you want to create a prompt which looks like a real photo, as the term “photorealistic” is used to describe an artificial image that looks real, not a real photo. |
|**qua4K**|Images in the dataset with the caption “4K/8K” are of high production value therefore will look more professionally photographed if you add this modifier. |

|**qua85mm**|Quite zoomed in photo, a lot of background blur and detail on subject |
|**qua200mm**|Extremely zoomed in photo, tons of background blur, & will look like it was photographed from a far distance and then zoomed in a lot (good for photos of flying birds, small animals). |
|**quaBokeh**| Enforce a large amount of background blur with clear outer bands, this can be used as a replacement for the “mm lens” prompts. Also could cause the subject to be closer to the camera. |
|**quaCinematic**|Adds a very atmospheric movie-like feel to the image, with great color tones and image composure, and can also add nice background blur and pretty camera angles. |
|**quaMacro**|Macro photo about it will be generated |
|**quaTiltShift**|Tilt-shift photo about it will be generated |
|**sitNature**|Photographs in the dataset with these captions tend to showcase animals/nature in extraordinary positions and situations, works similarly to “Award-Winning” but is only for nature. This will also make animals/nature look more real and accurate. |
